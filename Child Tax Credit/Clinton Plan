Clinton Plan

Clinton Increses the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 

increasing the phasein rate from 15 percent to 45 percent for the refundable portion of the credit, for families with eligible children under age 5. 

She would also eliminate the minimum earnings requirement
(currently $3,000) for all families with eligible children (under age 17) so that tax relief would
begin with the first dollar earned.

Benefit:
Today low- to upper-middle-income parents may claim up to $1,000 per child under the age of 17. 
Under Clinton's plan they could claim up to $2,000 for any children who are infants, toddlers or preschoolers, or $1,000 for those 5 and older.

Refundability:
That is, when the credit exceeds parents' taxable income, they can get at least part of it back as a refund. Currently, they can get back 15% of their earnings over $3,000, up to the credit's full $1,000-per-child value.
Clinton would expand that to 45% when the credit is taken for a child under age 5.

Phase In:
Eliminate the $3,000 minimum income requirement for all parents of children under 17. 
So those who qualify for the refundable portion of the credit could apply the 15% (or 45% for young kids) to all of their earnings.

Phase Out:
Today it starts when parents with two kids earn more than $110,000 ($75,000 if single or head of household), according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Once their income hits $150,000 ($115,000 if single or head of household) they would no longer be eligible to claim the credit.
